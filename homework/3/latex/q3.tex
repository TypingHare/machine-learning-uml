\begin{solution}
    \text{(a) to (k)} Implemented.

    \text{(l)} The almost identical performance between Linear Regression and Ridge Regression indicates that the current regularization is too weak to have any significant effect.
    The regularization term is used to prevent overfitting, but our training data set contains over 12,000 samples, which is large.
    On the other hand, the number of features is 8, which is much smaller than the number of samples.
    Therefore, Linear Regression performs well in this case.
