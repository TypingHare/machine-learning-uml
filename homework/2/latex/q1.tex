\begin{solution}
    Consider rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times.
    Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling any particular number is:

    \[
        p = \frac{1}{6}
    \]

    Since each roll is independent and we are interested in a specific number of successes, this scenario follows a binomial distribution.
    The probability mass function for a binomial distribution is:

    \[
        P(X = k \mid n, p) = \binom{n}{k} p^k(1 - p)^{n-k}
    \]

    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $n$ is the number of trials
        \item $k$ is the number of successes
        \item $p$ is the probability of success on each trial
    \end{itemize}

    In this problem, we want to find $P(X = 5)$ where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $n = 10$ (total number of rolls)
        \item $k = 5$ (number of sixes desired)
        \item $p = \frac{1}{6}$ (probability of rolling a six)
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore:
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            P(X = 5) &= \binom{10}{5} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 \\[1ex]
            &= \frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 \\[1ex]
            &= 252 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6^5}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5^5}{6^5}\right) \\[1ex]
            &\approx 0.0130
        \end{aligned}
    \]

    Thus, the probability of rolling exactly five sixes in ten rolls is approximately 1.30\%.
